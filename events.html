We are able to accomadate and host your events on our large property, with 5000 square feet open in the lodge, company parties,<br>
business meetings, and evening weddings.<br>
</p>
Wedding planning is exciting, yet sometimes stressful. Finding<br>
your wedding venue is one of the first decisions you will make.<br>
</p>
At Erehwon Lodge we want to make this your easiest decision.<br>
One where you will feel confident in your choice of Wedding Venue.<br>
After you have chosen us, we will help make your Dream Wedding a <br>
reality. We will tailor your wedding package to meet your needs. <br>
Weddings are not one size fits all and each has a different budget. <br>
Your dream wedding might include a beautiful venue with just nature as <br>
your backdrop and a very intimate guest list. Or perhaps your dream <br>
wedding is a beautiful venue with all your friends and family, and will <br>
include all your favorite colors and décor. From options with catering, <br>
décor, and anything else you could wish for, Erehwon Lodge is the <br>
perfect choice for you. 
</p>
Please contact us today. We would love to meet with you and <br>
discuss how we can make your day perfect for you. <br>
